# Loan Risk Prediction Project Development README

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the risk associated with loan applicants. The goal is to assist financial institutions in assessing the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting based on various attributes provided in the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains extensive information about loan applicants. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaminh/applicant-details-for-loan-approve/data). The dataset includes demographic details such as age, marital status, and homeownership status, as well as financial information such as income and car ownership. This diverse set of attributes provides a rich source of data for building predictive models.

## Development Process
1. **Data Exploration:** 
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and potential challenges such as class imbalance.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
   
3. **Data Imbalance Handling:** 
   - Utilized the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in the dataset, particularly in scenarios where one class significantly outweighs the other.
   
4. **Model Selection:** 
   - Explored various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to identify the best-performing model for predicting loan default risk.
   
5. **Model Evaluation:** 
   - Evaluated the selected models using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance on both training and testing datasets.
   
6. **Model Optimization:** 
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for the selected models to optimize their performance further.
   
7. **Model Deployment:** 
   - Selected the best-performing model and saved it for future use. Also, exported necessary data preprocessing steps and information for reproducibility.
   
8. **Insights and Recommendations:** 
   - Analyzed the results and provided insights into the performance of different models. Made recommendations for potential improvements or further analysis.

## Next Steps
- Explore advanced techniques for handling class imbalance, such as ensemble methods.
- Incorporate additional features or external data sources to enhance model performance.
